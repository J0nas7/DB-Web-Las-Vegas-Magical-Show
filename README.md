# DB-Web-Las-Vegas-Magical-Show

Make a database for Las Vegas Magical Stage.

Make a corresponding web site.

Make a table Magician with id, name, artist name and password.

This table must also hold a manager and one or more secretaries.

Make a table Act with title, performing magician, short description, duration and a link to a picture.

Make a table Program with id, act and sequence number.

The site must have a public welcome page showing the program (with pictures) plus total duration of the performance.

The site must have a simple login and logout page for all users.

If a magician logs in the magician should be able to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) own acts. Try to use a trigger to add a default picture link to acts with no picture data.

Make it possible to upload pictures to a folder in the project.

If a secretary logs in the secretary should be allowed to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) the persons.

If a manager logs in the manager should be able to select acts and their sequence for the program.

The web site should look professional.
